   - Stress tests (1000+ concurrent users)
   - Peak traffic simulation

4. **Feature Parity Suite**
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Exam management functionality
   - Student workflow verification

#### API Endpoints:

  -d '{"action": "deploy", "version": "2.0.0", "functions": [...]}'

# Monitor status
curl /api/admin/deployment?action=status
```

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Trigger rollback
curl -X POST /api/admin/rollback \
  -d '{"action": "manual_rollback", "reason": "Performance issues", "initiator": "admin"}'
```

### Run Validation Tests
```bash
# Run all validation suites
node scripts/run-migration-validation.js run-all both

# Run specific suite
node scripts/run-migration-validation.js run-suite consolidated-functions blue
```

### Traffic Management
```bash
# Gradual traffic shift
curl -X POST /api/admin/deployment \
  -d '{"action": "traffic_shift", "from_environment": "blue", "to_environment": "green", "percentage": 50, "gradual": true}'
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Checks
- **Admin API**: `/api/admin/health` (10s timeout, 3 retries)
- **Public API**: `/api/public/health` (10s timeout, 3 retries)
- **Attempts API**: `/api/attempts/health` (10s timeout, 3 retries)
- **Database**: Connection and query validation
- **Cache**: Consistency and performance checks

### Safety Thresholds
- **Error Rate**: Warning >2%, Critical >5%
- **Response Time**: Warning >1s, Critical >2s
- **Availability**: Warning <99%, Critical <95%
- **Throughput**: Warning <80% baseline, Critical <50% baseline

### Rollback Triggers
- **High Error Rate**: >5% for 2 minutes
- **Slow Response**: >2s for 3 minutes
- **Health Failures**: >3 failures in 1 minute
- **Traffic Drop**: >50% decrease for 5 minutes

## Security Considerations
