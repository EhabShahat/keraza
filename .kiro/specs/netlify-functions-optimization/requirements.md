# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Exam Application has exceeded Netlify's Functions limit, causing deployment failures and service disruptions. This feature addresses the critical need to optimize serverless function usage while maintaining 100% feature parity and system performance. The solution must eliminate the "This team has exceeded the Functions limit for mkexams" error through strategic architectural improvements and function consolidation.

2. WHEN exam settings are accessed THEN the system SHALL cache configuration data at the edge
3. WHEN student data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cache strategies
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL optimize query patterns to reduce execution time
5. IF data changes infrequently THEN the system SHALL implement long-term caching with proper invalidation
6. WHEN cache is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and freshness

### Requirement 4: Edge Computing and Static Generation

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to move appropriate logic to edge computing or static generation, so that server-side function usage is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static content is identified THEN the system SHALL move it to static generation or edge functions
2. WHEN configuration data is accessed THEN the system SHALL evaluate edge computing opportunities
3. WHEN user authentication is performed THEN the system SHALL optimize auth flows for edge deployment
4. WHEN public exam data is served THEN the system SHALL implement static generation where appropriate
5. IF content can be pre-generated THEN the system SHALL use Next.js static generation features
6. WHEN edge optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL reduce server-side function calls by at least 30%

### Requirement 5: Database and Architecture Optimization

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want optimized database interactions, so that function execution times are reduced and fewer functions are needed for data operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify and optimize slow queries
2. WHEN data access patterns are reviewed THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data fetching strategies
3. WHEN RPC functions are evaluated THEN the system SHALL optimize or consolidate Supabase stored procedures
4. WHEN database connections are managed THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and optimization
5. IF multiple queries serve similar purposes THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into efficient single queries
6. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL reduce average function execution time by at least 25%

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Prevention System

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want continuous monitoring of function usage, so that future limit breaches are prevented and system health is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL implement function usage monitoring and alerting
2. WHEN function limits approach thresholds THEN the system SHALL send proactive alerts
3. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track function execution patterns over time
4. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
5. IF usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL adapt monitoring thresholds accordingly
6. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards for function health

### Requirement 7: Zero-Downtime Migration and Rollback

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want seamless deployment of optimizations, so that users experience no service interruption during the migration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are deployed THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% uptime during migration
2. WHEN changes are applied THEN the system SHALL implement blue-green deployment strategies
3. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide immediate rollback capabilities
4. WHEN rollback is triggered THEN the system SHALL restore full functionality within 5 minutes
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically revert to the previous stable version
6. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify all functionality through automated testing

### Requirement 8: Feature Parity and Compatibility Assurance

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want all existing features to work exactly as before, so that users experience no functional degradation after optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% feature parity with the current version
2. WHEN API endpoints are consolidated THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing request/response formats
3. WHEN authentication flows are optimized THEN the system SHALL maintain security levels and user experience
4. WHEN admin functions are modified THEN the system SHALL preserve all administrative capabilities
5. IF student workflows are affected THEN the system SHALL ensure identical user experience
6. WHEN testing is performed THEN the system SHALL pass all existing test suites without modification
