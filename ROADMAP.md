Last updated: 2025-08-26T10:34:00+03:00

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - All core phases completed and tested

Legend: [x] Done · [ ] Todo · ⚠️ Needs Review

---

## Phase 0 — Project Setup & Foundations
- [x] Initialize Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript skeleton
- [x] Add Tailwind CSS v4 via PostCSS (`src/app/globals.css`, `postcss.config.mjs`)
- [x] Install core deps: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `clsx`, `seedrandom`, `react-hook-form`, `zod`
- [x] Environment variables file `.env.local` with Supabase URL/anon key and app brand
- [x] Supabase client utilities: `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`, `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
- [x] App providers (React Query): `src/app/providers.tsx` and wrapped in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- [x] Light-only theme enforced and UI primitives defined in `src/app/globals.css` (.card, .btn, .input, .select, .textarea, .table, .link); admin pages refactored to use them

Acceptance criteria:
- App boots locally at http://localhost:3000
- Tailwind classes render correctly

---

## Phase 1 — Database & Security (Supabase)
- [x] Schema tables created: `exams`, `questions`, `students`, `student_exam_attempts`, `exam_attempts`, `exam_results`, `exam_ips`, `audit_logs`, `admin_users`, `app_settings`
- [x] RPC functions: `start_attempt`, `get_attempt_state`, `save_attempt`, `submit_attempt`
- [x] RLS policies: public RPC access for student flows; admin-only table access via `admin_users`
- [x] Address advisors: set immutable `search_path` on functions flagged by Supabase Advisors
- [x] Add helpful indexes (e.g., `questions(exam_id, order_index)`, `student_exam_attempts(exam_id, student_id)` unique, `exam_attempts(exam_id, started_at)`, `exam_attempts(student_id)`) and finalize constraints; view `student_exam_summary`
- [x] Export migrations to repo (for reproducibility)

Acceptance criteria:
- All student RPCs callable by anon without exposing service key
- Advisors WARNs resolved; migrations stored in repo

---

## Phase 2 — Student Experience
- [x] Exam entry page: `/(public)/exam/[examId]` with name + optional code input
- [x] Attempt page: `/(public)/attempt/[attemptId]` with questions rendering
- [x] Auto-save on interval and manual save, version conflict resolution
- [x] Progress bar + timer (duration/end-time aware)
- [x] Display modes: single-question-per-page and full-exam view (toggle via `exams.settings.display_mode`)
- [x] Recovery mode: restore draft from server/localStorage on reload
- [x] Offline support: local backup + sync on reconnect
- [x] Question/option randomization seeded per attempt (wire to `randomize_questions` and seed)
- [x] Accessibility pass (labels, focus management, keyboard shortcuts)
  - Completed:
    - skip link + main landmarks
    - labeled inputs and error alerts on entry page
    - Timer ARIA
    - per-question ArrowLeft/ArrowRight navigation
    - ExamQuestion: fieldset/legend semantics; radiogroup/group with aria-labelledby; required attributes; paragraph textarea aria-required and association
    - Attempt page: save status live region (role="status" aria-live="polite", aria-atomic)

Acceptance criteria:
- Start attempt -> take exam -> submit works reliably with auto-save
- Display mode configurable; randomization consistent per student when enabled

---

## Phase 3 — Admin Authentication & Shell
- [x] Admin login (Supabase Auth) + route protection
- [x] Bootstrap first authenticated user to `admin_users`
- [x] Admin layout and nav shell (`/admin`)

Acceptance criteria:
- Only admin users can access `/admin/*` routes

---

## Phase 4 — Admin: Exam Management
- [x] Exams list with filtering/search
- [x] Create/edit exams
- [x] Duplicate exam action
- [x] Publish/archive flow
- [x] Settings editor: attempt limits, randomization, display mode, auto-save interval
- [x] Code mode toggle and generation for student codes (global `students.code`)

Acceptance criteria:
- Full CRUD + publish flow; settings persisted in `exams.settings`

---

## Phase 5 — Admin: Question Management
- [x] Question list per exam with reorder (drag-and-drop)
- [x] Reorder controls (basic up/down)
- [x] Create/edit questions for all types
- [x] CSV/XLSX import (Papa Parse/SheetJS) with validation + preview + error report
- [x] Rich text support for paragraph questions (basic editor)

Acceptance criteria:
- Bulk import works with preview & line-by-line errors

---

## Phase 6 — Admin: Student Management
- [x] Add/edit global students (unique codes) 
- [x] Bulk import students (CSV/XLSX) with validation

Acceptance criteria:
- Students can be registered/imported and linked to exams (if enabled)

---

## Phase 7 — Results & Analytics

- [x] Results table with filters (by exam, student, date)
- [x] Per-attempt details (basic, IP history)
- [x] Per-question analysis (basic)
- [x] Charts (correct rate per question, score distribution)
- [x] Export CSV
- [x] Export XLSX
- [x] PDF summary (optional)

Acceptance criteria:
- Admins can explore and export results; question analytics available

---

## Phase 8 — WhatsApp Integration
- [x] .env + provider setup (WhatsApp Cloud API)
- [x] Server route to send codes/messages
- [x] Admin UI: send codes to single/bulk students
- [x] Template management (basic)

Acceptance criteria:
